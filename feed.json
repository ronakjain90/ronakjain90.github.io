Keeping oneself above anything else. We have more people who act in their self-interest, instead of thinking of their community, locality, city, state, country, and planet.</p>\n<p>Statistically, if extreme human kindness is Gaussian distributed, we should still have about 2% of the world population above Mean + 2SD (standard deviation). 2% of 8B humans is 160M people, but we aren't reading about examples of extreme human compassion that often. What if the mean itself is heavily tilted towards self-interest philosophy, this could probably be due to human evolution wherein genetically we are programmed to survive first. Survival of the fittest is the game we are playing still now.</p>\n<p>But there exist individuals who have made significant contributions to humanity, whilst not enriching oneself[1]. Imagine a world where we have more people in the \"Greater Good\" Club when compared to the \"Self Interest\" Group. Wouldn't the world be such a lovely place to live?</p>\n<h6 id=\"1-how-one-company-gave-up-a-patent-and-saved-1-million-liveslessbrgreaterlessbrgreater\"><a href=\"https://www.cntraveller.in/story/invention-saved-million-lives-use-without-fail/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">[1] - How one company gave up a patent—and saved 1 million lives<br><br></a></h6>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",
