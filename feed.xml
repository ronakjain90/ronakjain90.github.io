<ul>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">Want to create 1,500 words content? easy.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">AI struggles at really hard problems. You'd never be able to code enterprise grade product with AI (just yet).
<ul>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">At work, I could write algorithms to generate trading signals. Impossible to do it with AI.</li>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">Write performant code taking into consideration current vs future scale. </li>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">Sometimes the smallest code change can have the biggest impact. AI can never develop the human intelligence to make that small change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While AI can never be in the Arena, AI programmers would struggle to sense what's wrong with their app without thinking from first principles.</li>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">Sometimes <strong>AI tries to cheat</strong>, so developers who just "Accept" are introducing bugs into code every day.</li>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">Everyone's got their unique coding style and introduce a personality into the codebase. AI spits out code with zero personality, often robotic.</li>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">AI defenders claiming that there would be more jobs, are dismissing the fact that there will be more noise than signal. For customers it's going to be extremely hard to determine signal and their subconscious mind would fall back on big-tech while making purchase decisions.</li>
<li>Industrial scale manufacturing created the problem of plenty, often leading to landfills. In this AI era, we are already seeing exponential growth in creation of vibe coded projects often getting flipped/shut down leading to long term decline in trust. 
<ul>
<li>eg: Product hunt is mostly AI apps and submissions and is already dead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-block="true" data-editor="a4o76" data-offset-key="2bfvl-0-0">Finally, there aren't those many jobs to feed 8 billion people. Not everything needs to be made at industrial scale.</li>

                <p>As a person in tech, I see that there is a lot of emphasis on scalability, speed, the next shiny doll that everyone wants to implement in their code, put it on their resume. But little emphasis is given on ease of maintenance. </p>
<p>I say ease of maintenance is a feature.</p>
<p>Ease of maintenance is how long it takes for someone to</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the source code</li>
<li>Set up the codebase while also installing all the relevant dependencies</li>
<li>Boot the codebase on a local machine</li>
<li>Make that one-line change</li>
<li>Do a small smoke test to ascertain everything is working correctly</li>
<li>Push the changes to git or other versioning system</li>
<li>Watch the CI/CD pipeline run and see the changes live
<ul>
<li>In some cases, this may also mean manually triggering a deploy because CD is not automated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If it takes you more than an hour to go through all the above steps, you are not maintaining the software, you are fighting against a complex, "shiny" piece of tech that's so good it takes ages to ship even a small one-line change.</p>
<p>Software should be built to future-proof against the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software ownership changes</li>
<li>Developers move on</li>
<li>That "shiny" piece of tech may not be maintained a year from now</li>
<li>There is a financial crisis, and the original code author is not available anymore</li>
<li>The team is too busy with other growth areas, but high maintenance is high friction.</li>
<li>The team is downsized from 100 engineers to 10 engineers, and not everyone would have experience with the codebase.</li>
<li>Certain skills are so rare it's impossible/beyond budget to hire talent for those skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software should be built to last forever.</p>

<p>When you perform actions that might not benefit you in any way and can sometimes not be in the best interest of your own-self, however, if the impact on the community is profound. Congratulations, you are a part of the "greater good" club. </p>

<p>Try answering the following questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the tax collection in many countries still so low?</li>
<li>Why is corruption so rampant in the developing world?</li>
<li>Why did some countries had and continue to have dictators?</li>
<li>Why is healthcare so unaffordable?</li>
<li>Why do politicians sometimes find ways to stay in power forever?</li>
<li>Why are some discoveries important to human existence patented?</li>
<li>Why does society have so much wealth inequality?</li>
<li>Why did the slave trade exist?</li>
<li>Why do politicians in some countries amass a fortune in their lifetime?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to many of the questions above can be attributed to self-first philosophy. Keeping oneself above anything else. We have more people who act in their self-interest, instead of thinking of their community, locality, city, state, country, and planet.</p>
<p>Statistically, if extreme human kindness is Gaussian distributed, we should still have about 2% of the world population above Mean + 2SD (standard deviation). 2% of 8B humans is 160M people, but we aren't reading about examples of extreme human compassion that often. What if the mean itself is heavily tilted towards self-interest philosophy, this could probably be due to human evolution wherein genetically we are programmed to survive first. Survival of the fittest is the game we are playing still now.</p>
<p>But there exist individuals who have made significant contributions to humanity, whilst not enriching oneself[1]. Imagine a world where we have more people in the "Greater Good" Club when compared to the "Self Interest" Group. Wouldn't the world be such a lovely place to live?</p>
