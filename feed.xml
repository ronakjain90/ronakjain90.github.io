  <p>
    Try answering the following questions
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why is the tax collection in so many countries still low?</li><li>Why is corruption so rampant?</li><li>Why did some countries had and continues to have dictators?</li><li>Why is healthcare so unaffordable?</li><li>Why are women sexually assaulted?</li><li>Why do politicians sometime find ways to stay in power forever?</li><li>Why are some discovery important to humans existence patented?</li><li>Why do society have so much wealth inequality?</li><li>Why did slave-trade exist?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The answer to many of the questions above can be inversely co-related to the "Greater Good Club". We have more people who act in their self-interest, instead of thinking of the greater good.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    But there exists individuals how have made significant contribution to human evolution, whilst not enriching one self [1][2][3][4][5]. Imagine the world where we have more people in the "Greater Good" Club, when compared to the "Self Love" Club? Wouldn't the world be such a lovely place to live?
